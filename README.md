### Introduction to Customer detail page
This page is basically prepared for the all active and churn customer details like Personal details, Demographic details and Account details so that we can compare the records of active and churn customers.

## Feedback
- As its a telecom business Phone services and Internet services better quality can play a important role to retain the customers.
- We need to focus on services except phone services and internet services like Online backup, Online Security and Tech-support.
- Apart from this we can provide attractive offers to our potential customers so that those customers can mention about the offer they get by company to the people around them, it will attract the new customers.
- We need to convert more monthly contract type customer to one year or two year contract type because as per analysis monthly customers are churning more than others.
